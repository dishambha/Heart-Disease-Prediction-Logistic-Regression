# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the presence of heart disease using Machine Learning techniques.
Logistic Regression is used as the classification algorithm to analyze medical parameters
and determine whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and treatment.

## 📊 Dataset
- Medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
- Target variable indicates presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading & Understanding
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Building (Logistic Regression)
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## ✅ Results
- Logistic Regression successfully classifies heart disease presence
- Model performance evaluated using accuracy score
